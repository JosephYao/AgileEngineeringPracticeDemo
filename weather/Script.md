#Step 1

Here is what we initially have before we start the demo:

*	final pom.xml
* 	final test.properties
*	final JBehaveStories.java
*	Pages.java
*	WeatherPage.java
*	index.jsp
*	web.xml
*	new_orleans_weather.xml

>	mvn verify

#Step 2

Here is what we will add in step 2:

* i_can_get_weather_by_zip.story
* WeatherTest.java
* JBehaveStories.java is updated (maybe this version should be created in step 1)
* pom.xml is updated (maybe this version should be created in step 1)

>	Explain and copy i_can_get_weather_by_zip.story
>	Explain and copy WeatherTest.java
>	mvn verify
